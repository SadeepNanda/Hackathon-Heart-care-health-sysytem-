# Hackathon-Heart-care-health-sysytem-
#

This project consists of a ML model in a fully responsive web page that predicts heart disease and correlated complications.
## DESCRIPTION

*Development in Health Sector and Disease prediction Models are in high demand.<br>
Our Prediction Model takes various inputs from users and predicts the disease and related complications <br>
So our model 'The heartunerring' gives a approach to solve the heart related errors to help people achieve a healthy heart.let's discuss in detail:<br>*
1. **User-dashboard page:**
The user dashboard takes various inputs like
- Age
- Gender
- Having Chest pain or not?
- Resting Blood pressure
- Serum cholestrol
- Fasting Blood Sugar
- Ecg
- Miniumum Heart rate
- Exercise induced Angina
- thal
- major-vessels

2. **Regression Models:** The various data sets are used to make regression models.<br>
3. **Disease prediction System:** The user inputs taken, and the model is trained to predict the heart related diseases and complications.

## Dependencies
**Libraries used in project:**
1. Pandas
2. Numpy
3. Seaborn
4. Matplotlib
5. Chart-Studio
6. Plotly
