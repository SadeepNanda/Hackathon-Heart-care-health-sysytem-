# Hackathon-Heart-care-health-sysytem-
#

This project consists of a ML model in a fully responsive web page that predicts heart disease and correlated complications.
## DESCRIPTION

*Development in Health Sector and Disease prediction Models are in high demand.<br>
Our Prediction Model takes various inputs from users and predicts the disease and related complications <br>
So our model 'The heartunerring' gives a approach to solve the heart related errors to help people achieve a healthy heart.let's discuss in detail:<br>*
1. *User-dashboard page:*
The user dashboard takes various inputs like
- Age
- Gender
- Having Chest pain or not?
- Resting Blood pressure
- Serum cholestrol
- Fasting Blood Sugar
- Ecg
- Maxiumum Heart rate
- Exercise induced Angina
- Number of major-vessels
- Thal

2. *Regression Models:* The various data sets are used to make regression models.<br>
3. *Disease prediction System:User Information Update* The user inputs taken, and the model is trained to predict the heart related diseases and complications.
4. *Disease prediction System:Result * The model predicts the chances of the patient to have heart disease and returns the probability to have a heart disease in the decimal notation where e denotes power of 10 multiplied with the fraction preceding 'e' 
## Dependencies
*Libraries used in project:*
1. Pandas
2. Numpy
3. Seaborn
4. Tensorflow
5. Keras
6. Sci-Kit Learn
7. Flask

#Execution of App
After installing all the required libraries run the app.py file in the terminal.The website starts running on :5000 localhost and the link is provided in the terminal.On visiting the link the user is directed to the home page of the website.
